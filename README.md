# Leaf physiology data and analyses for Joseph Terrones' greenhouse experiment

This repo contains raw data, R code, and other analyses for the leaf physiology add-on associated with Joseph Terrones' honors thesis project investigating impacts of nitrogen fertilization and BNF inoculation on soybean allocation strategies.

Repo currently includes two folders as placeholders:
 - 1. aci_data = raw Licor 6800 data for all A/Ci curve files. Data are raw files, so are not cleaned
 - 2. leaf_data = leaf area images curated from flat-bed scanner. JPEG images with file names corresponding with pot ID codes. Leaf area to be determined using "LeafArea" R package
